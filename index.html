            <p class="about">Hi Everyone! I am a CSE student at MSIT with a passion for web
                development. During my studies
                and internships, I've become skilled in front-end development which has enabled me to create attractive
                and interactive webpages. I always look forward to learning new technologies to improve my skills
                in the field.</p>

                About my project, it's a little game called Guess The Number where a number between 1 and 100 will be
                chosen randomly and the user have to guess that number. After each wrong guess the user will be given a
                hint that the number is greater or less than their gussed number. At the end when the user guess the
                number correctly, the game shows their score.
            </p>
            <p class="pne">About my experience, During my internship at CariKture, I gained practical experience in
                developing responsive websites, which enhanced my understanding of web development principles. I'm
                looking forward to gain more and more knowledge and experience in the field.</p>
